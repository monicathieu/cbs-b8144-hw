## Installation

You can install this package direct from GitHub using the following:

``` r
devtools::install_github("monicathieu/cbs-b8144-hw")
```

This package also depends on the `learnr` package, as well as a few other referenced packages, to run the tutorials correctly. These packages should be downloaded automatically along with this package.

## Example

To run an assignment, call a command like the following:

``` r
learnr::run_tutorial("assignment1", package = "cbs-b8144-hw")
```

Replace the number of the assignment with 2 or 3 if you are doing one of those assignments.

Running the assignment on your computer does not automatically submit your responses for grading! Refer to the instructions on the relevant Canvas assignment for more information on submission.
